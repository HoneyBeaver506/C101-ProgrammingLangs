1. What is it _at its core_?
Repeatedly Executes a code block as long as the given condition is true
2. How do you declare it?
```java
while(boolean_Expression){
// Statements
}
```
3. **Focus on the most common operations you'll use.** ("What's the most basic way to do X?")
-  *Break Statements*: Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
-  *Continue Statement*: Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and quickly resets its condition prior to reiterating.

## 🚀 Why & When to Use
**Why use it?** What are its advantages? 
-  Variables used are initialized before the loop begins. Ensure loops starts at defined state.
- If the initial condition is false, the loop will not execute.

**When to use it?** Provide 2-3 real-world scenarios. 
- Frequently used to repeatedly prompt for user input until a valid response is provided based on specific criteria.
- Used when collections of data are unknown or depend on a condition (E.G. Processing until a specific value is encountered)

### When to Consider Alternatives:
**When _not_ to use it?** When might another data structure be better?
Use for loops when the sets of data are known and a specific range can be specified.

## ✍️ Syntax & Key Operations

### Example:
```java
public static void main(String args[]) {
	int x = 10;

	while(x < 20) { // While X is less than 20
	System.out.println("Value of X:" + x) // Print X
	x++; // Increment X
	System.out.println("\n"); // Prints New line
	
	}
}

/* OUTPUT:
value of x : 10
value of x : 11
value of x : 12
value of x : 13
value of x : 14
value of x : 15
value of x : 16
value of x : 17
value of x : 18
value of x : 19
*/

1. What is it _at its core_?
Similar to a `while loop`, except that a `do .. while` loop is guaranteed to execute at least one time. **Needing to execute function at least once before repeats**
2. How do you declare it?
```java
do {
// Statements
}while(Boolean_Expression); // Ensures code is executed at least once.
```
1. Focus on the most common operations you'll use. ("What's the most basic way to do X?")

## 🚀 Why to Use
**Why use it?** What are its advantages? 
-  *User Input Validation* - Prompting the user for input and needing to ensure the input meets certain criteria.
- *Menu Driven programs* - When displaying a menu of options to the user and then processing the selection. Menu will be displayed at least once.
- When execution depends on data or actions performed within the loop’s first iteration.
- Printing Elements of an array using `do while`
### When to Consider Alternatives:
**When _not_ to use it?** When might another data structure be better?
`While Loops` are better when needing to keep a loop to condition. The `do .. while loop` makes sure a list of options is displayed at least once before the loop is done.



## ✍️ Syntax & Key Operations

### Example
```java
public static void main(String args[]) {
int x = 10;

do { // Executes at least once
System.out.print("value of x : " + x ); 
x++; 
System.out.print("\n");
}while(x < 20); // Executes in a loop 
}

/* OUTPUT:
value of x : 10
value of x : 11
value of x : 12
value of x : 13
value of x : 14
value of x : 15
value of x : 16
value of x : 17
value of x : 18
value of x : 19

# 🎯 Concept - Java For Loop

![[J4.1 - Loop Control 2025-06-27 09.43.49.excalidraw]]

1. What is it _at its core_?
Repetition control structured used to execute a  block of code ==a specific number of times.==
- *Entry Control loop* - Checks the given condition before executing the loop body. 

2. How do you declare it?
```java
for(init; boolean_expression; update) {
// statements
}
```

3. Focus on the most common operations you'll use. ("What's the most basic way to do X?")
- *Initialization* - Defines where the loop starts and is the counter variable 
- *Boolean Expression (Condition)* - Evaluates before each iteration. If determined true it continues the loop until the condition is evaluated to false. ==limiter==
- *Body* - Contains the statements to be executed again and again as long as the condition remains true. The section may also include the update to the counter.
- *Update* - Modifies loop counter at the end of each iteration

## 🚀 Why & When to Us
**Why use it?** What are its advantages? 
- Structured and Readable syntax makes it more reliable and concise
- Prevents infinite loops
- Counting and Iterating a known number of times


**When to use it?** Provide 2-3 real-world scenarios. 
- Iterating Over Arrays
- Performing Calculations
- Handling Repetitive Operations

### When to Consider Alternatives:
**When _not_ to use it?** When might another data structure be better?
1. When the number of iterations is unknown, its best to do a `while loop`
2. When you need an iteration to execute at least once use a `while loop`
3. When iterating through collections in  in a simple and readable way use an `enhanced for loop`

## ✍️ Syntax & Key Operations

### Example
```Java
public static main(String args[]) {
for(int x = 10; x < 20; x = x + 1) {
// Creates a counter that starts at 10
// Condition specifies the loop continues until x is less than 20
// Adds 1 to x with each iteration (Update)

System.out.print("value of x : " + x ); 
System.out.print("\n");
}
}

/* OUTPUT: (EXCLUSIVE)
value of x : 10
value of x : 11
value of x : 12
value of x : 13
value of x : 14
value of x : 15
value of x : 16
value of x : 17
value of x : 18
value of x : 19
*/
```

# 🎯 Concept - Java For .. Each Loop
1. What is it _at its core_?
Special repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to be executed a specific number of times.
2. How do you declare it?
```java
for(declaration : Expression) {
// satements
}
```
1. Focus on the most common operations you'll use. ("What's the most basic way to do X?")
- *Declaration* - Compatible with arrays.  Value should be the same as the current array element
- *Expression* - Evaluates the array you need to loop through. Returns an array.

## 🚀 Why & When to Use

### Advantages:
**Why use it?** What are its advantages? 
- Useful when you do not know how many times a task needs to be repeated.
- Need to access an index of elements, process elements in reverse order, or skip certain elements based on their index

### Use Cases:
**When to use it?** Provide 2-3 real-world scenarios. 
- Iterating over a list of intergers (Array)
- Iterating over an array of strings
- Iterating over an array of Objects

### When to Consider Alternatives:
**When _not_ to use it?** When might another data structure be better?
Use a `while` loop when the number of elements is known.



## ✍️ Syntax & Key Operations

### Example
```Java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public static void main(Strings args[]) {
List<Interger> numbers = Arrays.asList(10,20,30,40,50); // Creates an Array as a list

for (Interger x : numbers){ // Takes the interger x which is the name of the array list and loops through each number.
System.out.print( x );  // Prints out X (numbers)
System.out.print(","   // Prints out a comma after each number.
}
}
/* OUTPUT (INCLUSIVE)
10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
*/
```

## 🎯 What & Why
**Purpose**:
An `if-then` statement in Java executes a block of code only if a specified condition evaluates to `true`

**Use When:** 
You need your program to make decisions and execute different code paths based on certain conditions

**Analogy:**
Think of an `if-then` statement like a bouncer at a club. If (the condition) you're on the guest list, then (the action) you are allowed to enter. If you're not on the guest list, nothing happens, and you don't get in.

**Choose this when:** 
You need to execute code selectively based on whether a specific condition or set of conditions is true. They are fundamental for any program that needs to adapt its behavior. **Avoid when:** You have a large number of mutually exclusive conditions that can be better handled by `switch` statements (for exact value matches) or polymorphism (for object-oriented designs). **Alternatives:**
- **`switch` statement:** For multiple conditions based on the exact value of a single variable.
- **Ternary operator (`? :`):** For simple `if-else` assignments or returns.
- **Polymorphism:** In object-oriented programming, using different object types to handle different behaviors, often replacing large `if-else if` ladders.

## ⚡ Core Syntax
```java
// Basic if-then statement
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}

// Real-world example
int temperature = 25;

if (temperature > 20) {
    System.out.println("It's a warm day! "); // This line will be executed
}
```

---
## 🔧 Essential Methods
1. Method 1
### Method 1: Basic `if` Statement (80% use case)
```java
int score = 85;

if (score >= 60) { // Check if the score is greater than or equal to 60
    System.out.println("You passed the exam!"); // This will be printed
}
```

**When to use:** When you need to perform an action only when a single condition is met. **Best for:** Simple conditional execution, validating input, or enabling features based on a flag.

### Method 2: `if-else` Statement (15% use case)

```java
int age = 17;

if (age >= 18) { // Check if the age is 18 or more
    System.out.println("You are an adult.");
} else { // If the condition is false
    System.out.println("You are a minor."); // This will be printed
}
```

**When to use:** When you have two mutually exclusive outcomes based on a single condition (either this or that). **Best for:** Handling binary choices, such as "login success or failure," "item in stock or out of stock."

### Method 3: `if-else if-else` Ladder (5% use case)

```java
int grade = 75;

if (grade >= 90) { // Check for A
    System.out.println("Grade: A");
} else if (grade >= 80) { // Check for B if not A
    System.out.println("Grade: B");
} else if (grade >= 70) { // Check for C if not A or B
    System.out.println("Grade: C"); // This will be printed
} else { // All other cases
    System.out.println("Grade: F");
}
```

**When to use:** When you have multiple conditions that need to be checked in a specific order, and only one block of code should execute. **Best for:** Categorizing data, implementing tiered logic (e.g., tax brackets, discount levels), or handling multiple distinct states.

![[J4.1 - Loop Control 2025-07-27 00.01.27.excalidraw]]
**Diagram Explanation:**
- Input: A boolean expression (the condition) that evaluates to either `true` or `false`.
- Process: The program evaluates the given condition. If it's `true`, the code block inside the `if` statement is executed. If it's `false`, that code block is skipped.
- Output: The result of executing the code block (or not) based on the condition. The program continues its flow after the `if` statement.

---
## ⚖️ Quick Pros/Cons
*Advantages:*
- **Control Flow:** Allows programs to make decisions and execute specific code blocks based on conditions, leading to dynamic and responsive applications.
- **Readability:** When used appropriately, `if-then` and related statements make code easier to understand by clearly defining different execution paths.
- **Maintainability:** Well-structured conditional logic can be easier to debug and modify as requirements change.
- **Flexibility:** Can be combined with `else` and `else if` to handle multiple scenarios and create complex decision-making logic.

*Disadvantages:*
- **Complexity:** Overuse of nested `if-else` statements (known as "arrow code" or "pyramid of doom") can lead to code that is difficult to read, understand, and maintain.
- **Performance Cost:** While generally negligible for simple conditions, complex conditions or deeply nested `if` statements can introduce slight overhead due to multiple evaluations.
- **Testability:** Complex conditional logic can increase the number of possible execution paths, making it more challenging to write comprehensive unit tests.
- **Maintainability (for bad code):** Poorly structured or overly complex conditional logic can be a nightmare to maintain and extend.

## 🐛 Common Issues
### Issue 1: Forgetting Curly Braces for Multiple Statements

**Error Message:** (Often no compile-time error, but logical error) **Cause:** Without curly braces `{}`, an `if` statement only executes the _immediately following single statement_ if the condition is true. If you intend to execute multiple statements, they must be enclosed in curly braces. **Quick Fix:** Always use curly braces for `if` blocks, even for a single statement, to prevent future errors and improve readability. **Prevention:** Adopt a consistent coding style that always includes curly braces for `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, etc., blocks.

### Issue 2: Using `\=\` instead of `\==\` for Comparison

**Symptoms:** Compile-time error: "incompatible types: int cannot be converted to Boolean" or "required: Boolean, found: int". Or, unexpected behavior if comparing booleans where assignment is valid. **Root Cause:** A single equals sign (`\=\`) is the assignment operator, while a double equals sign (`\==\`) is the comparison operator. In an `if` condition, a Boolean expression is expected. **Solution:** Always use `\==\` for comparison in conditional statements. **Code Example:**

```java
// Incorrect
int x = 10;
if (x = 5) { // ERROR: Cannot convert int to boolean
    System.out.println("x is 5");
}

// Corrected Code Example
int y = 10;
if (y == 5) { // Correct comparison
    System.out.println("y is 5");
} else {
    System.out.println("y is not 5, it's " + y); // This will be printed
}
```

### Issue 3: Nested `if` Statements Becoming Unreadable
**When it occurs:** When `if` statements are deeply nested, creating a "pyramid of doom." **Debug approach:** Use a debugger to step through the code execution path. Carefully examine each condition. **Resolution:*
- **Refactor using logical operators:** Combine multiple simple `if` conditions with `&&` (AND) or `||` (OR).
- **Early exit/return:** If a condition means no further processing is needed, return from the method early.
- **Extract methods:** Encapsulate complex nested logic into separate, well-named methods.
- **Polymorphism:** For object-oriented designs, consider using polymorphism to avoid large `if-else if` chains.


---

## 💡 Key Tips
### Performance Tips
- **Order conditions strategically:** In `if-else if` ladders, place the most frequently met conditions first to minimize the number of evaluations.
- **Short-circuiting:** Utilize Java's short-circuiting logical operators (`&&` and `||`). If the first operand of `&&` is `false`, the second is not evaluated. If the first operand of `||` is `true`, the second is not evaluated. This can save unnecessary computations.
    

### Code Quality Tips
- **Always use curly braces:** Even for single-statement `if` blocks, using curly braces prevents future bugs if more statements are added later and improves readability.
- **Keep conditions simple:** Complex conditions can be hard to read. Break them down into smaller, more manageable boolean variables if necessary.
- **Avoid deep nesting:** If you find yourself with more than 2-3 levels of nested `if` statements, consider refactoring using early exits, logical operators, or extracting methods.
- **Use meaningful variable names:** Clearly name boolean variables and conditions to make the intent obvious.
    

### Debugging Tips
- **Print statements:** Temporarily add `System.out.println()` statements inside `if` and `else` blocks to see which path the execution takes and the values of variables involved in the conditions.
- **Use a debugger:** Set breakpoints on `if` statements and step through your code. Inspect variable values to understand why a condition is evaluating to `true` or `false`.
- **Isolate the condition:** If a condition is complex, try to evaluate it separately before the `if` statement to ensure it produces the expected boolean result.
    

### Production Considerations
- **Robust input validation:** Use `if` statements to validate all external inputs (user input, file data, network data) to prevent unexpected program behavior or security vulnerabilities.
- **Logging:** Incorporate logging within `if` and `else` blocks, especially for critical decision points, to aid in post-production debugging and understanding application flow.
- **Error handling:** Combine `if` statements with `try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle potential exceptions that might arise from conditional logic (e.g., `if (object != null)` before accessing its methods).

## 🎯 What & Why
**Purpose**: 
A Switch statement in java allows a program to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a single variable or expression. It provides an alternative to long if else ladders when comparing a var to multiple fixed values.

**Use When:** 
You need to perform different actions based on discrete, enumerated set of possible values for a variable, such as menu choices, status codes, or different types of objects.

**Analogy:**
Imagine a vending machine. You select an item by pressing a button with a specific code (the value). The machine then performs a specific action (delivers the item) based on that code. If you press a code it doesn't recognize, it might do nothing or display an error.

---

## ⚡ Core Syntax
```java
// Basic switch statement (Java 14+)
// This syntax is known as 'switch expression' or 'enhanced switch'
// It can return a value and doesn't require 'break' for each case (unless falling through intentionally)
int dayOfWeek = 3;
String dayName = switch (dayOfWeek) {
    case 1 -> "Monday";
    case 2 -> "Tuesday";
    case 3 -> "Wednesday"; // This case will be matched
    case 4 -> "Thursday";
    case 5 -> "Friday";
    case 6 -> "Saturday";
    case 7 -> "Sunday";
    default -> "Invalid day";
};
System.out.println("Today is " + dayName); // Output: Today is Wednesday

// Traditional switch statement (pre-Java 14 and still widely used)
char grade = 'B';
switch (grade) {
    case 'A':
        System.out.println("Excellent!");
        break; // Important: 'break' exits the switch statement
    case 'B':
        System.out.println("Good!"); // This will be printed
        break;
    case 'C':
        System.out.println("Pass");
        break;
    case 'D':
    case 'F': // Multiple case labels can share the same code block
        System.out.println("Fail");
        break;
    default: // Executed if none of the case values match
        System.out.println("Invalid grade");
        break;
}
```

---
## 🔧 Essential Methods
### Method 1: Traditional `switch` Statement with `break` (80% use case)

This is the classic way to use `switch` in Java, widely compatible across versions. Each
`case` block must explicitly use `break` to prevent "fall-through".

```java
String command = "start";

switch (command) {
    case "start":
        System.out.println("Starting service..."); // This will be printed
        break; // Exits the switch
    case "stop":
        System.out.println("Stopping service...");
        break;
    case "restart":
        System.out.println("Restarting service...");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Unknown command.");
        break;
}
```

**When to use:** When you need to execute distinct blocks of code for various discrete values of a variable. This is suitable for older Java versions or when explicit fall-through behavior is desired. **Best for:** Menu-driven applications, processing enumerated types, or handling different states in a finite state machine.

### Method 2: `switch` Expression (Java 14+) (15% use case)

Introduced in Java 14 as a preview feature and standardized in Java 17, `switch` expressions offer a more concise syntax and can return a value. The
`->` syntax implicitly breaks, preventing fall-through by default.

```java
int month = 7;
String season = switch (month) {
    case 1, 2, 12 -> "Winter"; // Multiple labels for one case
    case 3, 4, 5 -> "Spring";
    case 6, 7, 8 -> "Summer"; // This will be matched, and "Summer" returned
    case 9, 10, 11 -> "Autumn";
    default -> "Invalid month";
};
System.out.println("Month " + month + " is in " + season); // Output: Month 7 is in Summer
```

**When to use:** When you want the `switch` statement to produce a single result, or when you prefer a more compact and less error-prone syntax compared to traditional `switch`. Requires Java 14 or newer. **Best for:** Mapping input values to output values, concise conditional assignments, and reducing boilerplate.

### Method 3: `switch` with `yield` (Java 14+) (5% use case)

Used within a `switch` expression when a `case` block needs to execute multiple statements before yielding a value. This provides more flexibility than the
`->` syntax for complex cases.

```java
char operation = '*';
double num1 = 10.0;
double num2 = 5.0;

double result = switch (operation) {
    case '+':
        yield num1 + num2;
    case '-':
        yield num1 - num2;
    case '*': { // Block for multiple statements
        System.out.println("Performing multiplication...");
        yield num1 * num2; // This case will yield 50.0
    }
    case '/':
        if (num2 != 0) {
            yield num1 / num2;
        } else {
            System.err.println("Error: Division by zero.");
            yield Double.NaN; // Not a Number
        }
    default:
        System.err.println("Invalid operation.");
        yield Double.NaN;
};
System.out.println("Result: " + result); // Output: Performing multiplication... \n Result: 50.0
```

**When to use:** When a `switch` expression's `case` needs to perform side effects (like printing to console) or complex logic before yielding its result.

**Best for:** Scenarios where a single `case` requires more than a simple expression for its result.

## ⚖️ Quick Pros/Cons
*Advantages:*
- **Readability:** For multiple comparisons against a single variable, `switch` statements are often more readable and cleaner than a long `if-else if-else` chain.
    
- **Performance:** In some cases, compilers can optimize `switch` statements (especially with integral types) into jump tables, which can be slightly faster than evaluating multiple `if` conditions.
    
- **Clarity:** Clearly indicates that you are branching based on the value of a single expression, making the intent of the code more obvious.
    
- **New Features (Java 14+):** `switch` expressions simplify syntax, reduce boilerplate (`break` statements), and allow `switch` to be used in contexts where an expression is required (e.g., assigning a value directly).

*Disadvantages:*
- **Limited to specific types:** `switch` statements can only work with a limited set of data types: `byte`, `short`, `char`, `int`, their corresponding wrapper classes (`Byte`, `Short`, `Character`, `Integer`), `String`s, and enums. You cannot use
    
    `long`, `float`, `double`, or `boolean` directly.
    
- **Fall-through (Traditional `switch`):** If `break` statements are omitted in a traditional `switch`, execution will "fall through" to the next `case` block, which is a common source of bugs if unintended.
    
- **No Range Checking:** `switch` statements only support exact value matches. You cannot check for ranges (e.g.,
    `case x to y:`) directly. For range checks,
    `if-else if-else` is necessary.
    
- **Complexity:** For very complex branching logic or when conditions are not based on discrete values, `if-else if-else` or polymorphism might be more appropriate.

----
Tradeoff Summary:
**Choose this when:** 
	You are comparing a single expression against many discrete, fixed values, especially for integral types, strings, or enums. The enhanced `switch` expression (Java 14+) is excellent for concisely mapping input values to results.

**Avoid when:** 
	You need to check for ranges, complex boolean conditions, or when dealing with `long`, `float`, `double`, or `boolean` types directly in the comparison. Also, avoid if you are using an older Java version and might find the `break` statement requirement error-prone. 

**Alternatives:**
- **`if-else if-else` ladder:** More flexible for range checks and complex boolean conditions.
    
- **Polymorphism:** In object-oriented programming, using different object types to handle different behaviors can often replace large `switch` statements that switch on an object's type.
    
- **Strategy Pattern:** A design pattern that uses polymorphic behavior to replace conditional logic with object-oriented dispatch.

## 🐛 Common Issues
### Issue 1: Missing `break` Statements (Traditional `switch`)
**Symptoms:** Unexpected code execution. Code from subsequent

`case` blocks runs even if their conditions don't match, leading to incorrect program behavior.

**Error Message:** No compile-time error, it's a logical error.

**Cause:** In traditional `switch` statements, once a `case` is matched, execution continues into subsequent `case` blocks until a `break` statement is encountered or the `switch` block ends.

**Quick Fix:** Ensure every `case` block (unless intentional fall-through is desired) ends with a `break;` statement. **Prevention:** Use `switch` expressions (`->` syntax) if on Java 14+ as they implicitly break. For traditional `switch`, be diligent about adding `break` or use IDE features that warn about fall-through.

### Issue 2: No `default` Case
**Symptoms:** The program does not handle unexpected input values gracefully. If the `switch` expression's value doesn't match any `case` and there's no `default` (or `yield` in expressions), no code is executed, or in `switch` expressions, a `MatchException` might be thrown at runtime.

**Root Cause:** The `switch` statement needs a fallback for values that don't match any explicit `case`.

**Solution:** Always include a `default` case to handle all unmatched values. This makes your code more robust.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Incorrect (no default)
int choice = 5;
switch (choice) {
    case 1: System.out.println("One"); break;
    case 2: System.out.println("Two"); break;
    // If choice is 5, nothing happens here. Potentially a bug.
}

// Corrected Code Example
int choiceCorrected = 5;
switch (choiceCorrected) {
    case 1: System.out.println("One"); break;
    case 2: System.out.println("Two"); break;
    default: // Handles any other value
        System.out.println("Invalid choice: " + choiceCorrected); // This will be printed
        break;
}
```

### Issue 3: Using Unsupported Data Types
**When it occurs:** Attempting to `switch` on `long`, `float`, `double`, or `boolean` data types.

**Debug approach:** Compiler will throw an error: "incompatible types: bad operand type for switch statement". **Resolution:**
- For `long`, `float`, `double`: Convert them to `int` or `String` if appropriate, or use `if-else if-else` statements.
- For `boolean`: An `if-else` statement is always the correct choice.

```java
// Example of unsupported type
// boolean isLoggedIn = true;
// switch (isLoggedIn) { // Compile-time error
//     case true: ...
// }

// Correct approach for boolean
boolean isLoggedIn = true;
if (isLoggedIn) {
    System.out.println("User is logged in.");
} else {
    System.out.println("User is logged out.");
}
```

## 💡 Key Tips
### Performance Tips

- **Integral Types:** For `int`, `byte`, `short`, `char`, `switch` statements can sometimes be optimized by the JVM into jump tables, which provides O(1) average time complexity for dispatch.
    
- **String `switch`:** While convenient, `switch` on `String`s can be slightly slower than `switch` on integral types because it involves `String.equals()` comparisons and hash code calculations. For extremely performance-critical code with many string cases, converting to an
    
    `enum` or `int` beforehand might be considered.
    

### Code Quality Tips

- **Always use `default`:** Even if you think all cases are covered, a `default` case is crucial for handling unexpected values and making your `switch` statement more robust and future-proof.
    
- **Group related cases:** Use multiple `case` labels for the same block of code to reduce duplication. For enhanced
    
    `switch` (`->`), this is done with comma-separated values (`case 1, 2, 3 -> ...`). For traditional
    
    `switch`, this means stacking `case` labels without `break` statements before the shared code block.
    
- **Keep case logic concise:** If a `case` block becomes too large or complex, consider extracting its logic into a separate method.
    
- **Use enums:** For a fixed set of named constants, `enum` types are ideal for use with `switch` statements. This improves type safety and readability.
    

### Debugging Tips

- **Step-through:** Use a debugger to step line by line through your `switch` statement. Observe the value of the `switch` expression and see which `case` (or `default`) branch is taken.
    
- **Temporary prints:** Add `System.out.println()` statements inside each `case` and the `default` block to trace execution flow.
    
- **Check for fall-through:** If experiencing unexpected behavior in a traditional `switch`, carefully inspect each `case` for missing `break` statements.
    

### Production Considerations

- **Exhaustiveness (Java 14+ `switch` expressions with enums):** When using `switch` expressions with `enum` types, the compiler can check if all enum constants are covered. If not, it can issue a warning or error, helping to prevent runtime
    `MatchException`s.
    
- **Security:** Be cautious when using `switch` statements with external, untrusted input. Always validate input _before_ passing it to a `switch` statement to prevent unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities.
    
- **Future compatibility:** When writing new code, consider using the enhanced `switch` expression (Java 14+) for its improved safety and conciseness, especially if your project can adopt newer Java versions.
