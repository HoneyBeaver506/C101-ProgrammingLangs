# Decision Making Statements

| Statement                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **If Statement**                          | Consists of boolean expression followed by one or more statements                                                                                                                                                              |
| **If ‚Ä¶ Else Statements**                  | Followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the boolean expression is false                                                                                                                                    |
| **Nested If Else**                        | Can use one if or else if statement inside of another statement                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Switch Statement**                      | Allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values                                                                                                                                                           |
| **?:**                                    | Conditional Operator. Used to replace if Else statements. *Syntax*: `exp1 ? exp2 : exp3`                                                                                                                                       |
| Conditionals for **Conditional Operator** | - If the value of exp1 is true, then the value of Exp2 will be the value of the whole expression.<br>    <br>- If the value of exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the entire expression. |

## If & If else statements
[[J3 - Java Input & Output]] - Comparison Operators

The `if` statement is the simplest form of decision-making. It runs a block of code only if a specific condition is true.
	**Analogy**: If its raining, Use an Umbrella
**SYNTAX:**
```txt
if(Boolean_expression[True or False]) { 
// Executes when the Boolean expression is true 
}
```

The `else` statement provides an alternative path. It runs a block of code if the `if` condition is false. It always follows an `if` statement.
- **Analogy**: If it's raining, take an umbrella; **else** (otherwise), leave it at home.
```txt
if (condition) { 
// Code to run if the condition is true 
} else { 
// Code to run if the condition is false 
}
```


## Ladder if Else
Literally an if else decision maker followed by another while respecting the code indentations.

- An if can have zero or one else's and it must come after any else if's.
- An if can have zero to many else if's and they must come before the else.
- Once an else if succeeds, none of the remaining else if's or else's will be tested.

# Switch Case
![[J4 - Decision Making Statements 2025-06-26 10.44.36.excalidraw]]
## üéØ Concept
1. What is it _at its core_?
Allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values and cases. 
2. How do you declare it?
```txt
switch(expression) { 
case value : 
// Statements 
break; // optional 
case value : 
// Statements 
break; // optional 
// You can have any number of case statements. 
default : // Optional 
// Statements }
```
3. Focus on the most common operations you'll use. ("What's the most basic way to do X?")
- **Case Labels**: Associated with a specific value to be compared to the expression
- **Break Statement**: Prevents a fall through, breaking a case whenever it needs to be skipped.
	- Happens naturally in languages like C & C++
- **Default Case**: Provides a way to handle cases when other case matches the value
- `if-else` statements often chain and fil the code with more lines.


## üöÄ Why & When to Use

### 
**Why use it?** What are its advantages? 
- Can be used when using multiple `if-else` statements, shortening the code and making it cleaner
- Helps test a condition using different cases
‚Ä¢ Variables in a switch can be integers, convertable integers, strings, and enums.
‚Ä¢ Multiple case statements can be included within a switch.
‚Ä¢ Case value must match the variable in the switch and must be a constant or literal.
‚Ä¢ If the variable equals a case, subsequent statements execute until a break statement is reached.
‚Ä¢ The switch terminates when a break is reached, reversing control flow to the next line.
‚Ä¢ An optional default case can be included at the end of the switch for tasks where none of the cases are true.
**When to use it?** Provide 2-3 real-world scenarios. 
- Handling multiple if-else chains
- Helpful with things that require multiple inputs like grades and such
- Helpful when needing to keep code well structured and formatted

## ‚úçÔ∏è Syntax & Key Operations

```java
public static void main(String argd[]){
	char grade = 'C';

switch(grade) {
case 'A':
	System.out.println("Excellent);
	break;
case 'B':
	System.out.println("Well Done");
	break
default:
	System.out.println("Invalid Grade");
}
}
```
