## üéØ What & Why
**Purpose**
	Exception handling in Java is a mechanism for managing runtime errors to maintain the normal flow of an application. An exception is an unexpected event that can disrupt a program's execution. By handling exceptions, you can anticipate specific errors and gracefully recover from them, preventing the program from crashing. This approach separates error-handling code from the main program logic, making the code cleaner and more readable.

**Use When:** 
- **Input Validation:** Exceptions are often used to handle invalid data from users, such as a non-numeric string where a number is expected. 
- **Resource Management:** They are essential for managing external resources like files or database connections, ensuring resources are properly closed even if an error occurs.
- **Network Communication:** Exception handling is crucial for applications that communicate over a network, as connections can fail or data can be corrupted.

## ‚ö° Core Syntax
Different Approaches to handle Exception in Java:
- try ... Catch Block
- Finally block
- Throw and Throws keyword


**Try...Catch Block**
```java
try {

} catch(Exception e) {

}
```
When an Exception occurs, it is caught by the catch block. The catch block cannot be used first without the try block.
- Can use Multiple catch blocks to handle different exceptions depending on the use case

> The `try` block contains the code that might throw an exception, while the `catch` block handles the exception if it occurs.

*Example Code*
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    try {

      // code that generate exception
      int divideByZero = 5 / 0;
      System.out.println("Rest of code in try block");
    }
    
    catch (ArithmeticException e) {
      System.out.println("ArithmeticException => " + e.getMessage());
    }
  }
}
// Output: ArithmeticException => / by zero
```
Error Happened because the program tried to divide a number by 0.
- `.getMessage()` - Prints out the error message into the console


**Finally Block**: (OPTIONAL) - Always executed no matter weather there is an exception or not. Works with the `try...catch` block.
```java
try {

} catch(ExceptionType1 e1) {

} finally {

}
```
The `finally` block is optional and contains code that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught. It is commonly used for cleanup tasks like closing resources.

*Example Code:*
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      // code that generates exception
      int divideByZero = 5 / 0;
    }

    catch (ArithmeticException e) {
      System.out.println("ArithmeticException => " + e.getMessage());
    }
    
    finally {
      System.out.println("This is the finally block");
    }
  }
}
```
1. Error: Tried to divide number by 0
2. Finally: Prints out optional message to the console.


**Throw and Throws Keyword**
- The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw a single exception from a method.
	- Used to declare the type of exceptions that might occur within the method. It is called a **Method Declaration**.
```java
class Main {
  public static void divideByZero() {

    // throw an exception
    throw new ArithmeticException("Trying to divide by 0");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    divideByZero();
  }
}
/* 
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: Trying to divide by 0
        at Main.divideByZero(Main.java:5)
        at Main.main(Main.java:9)
*/
```

- The `throws` keyword is used in a method signature to declare which checked exceptions the method might throw. This forces the calling method to either handle the exception or re-declare it with `throws`.'
```java
import java.io.*;

class Main {
  // declareing the type of exception
  public static void findFile() throws IOException {

    // code that may generate IOException
    File newFile = new File("test.txt");
    FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream(newFile);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      findFile();
    }
    catch (IOException e) {
      System.out.println(e);
    }
  }
}
// Output: java.io.FileNotFoundException: test.txt (The system cannot find the file specified)
```
1. If the file does not exist, `FileInputStream` throws a `FileNotFoundException` which extends the `IOException` class.
2. `findFile()` - Method that allows the `FileFoundException` to be thrown

---
## üîß Essential Methods
**Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions**
- **Checked Exceptions:** These are exceptions that the compiler checks at compile time. They must be handled either by a `try-catch` block or by being declared in the method signature with the `throws` keyword. Examples include `IOException` and `SQLException`.
    
- **Unchecked Exceptions:** These exceptions are not checked at compile time and occur at runtime. The compiler does not require you to handle them. They typically represent programming errors. Examples include `NullPointerException` and `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
    
- **Errors:** These are subclasses of `Throwable` but not `Exception`. They represent serious problems that applications should not try to catch, such as `StackOverflowError`.
    

**Custom Exceptions** You can create your own custom exceptions to provide meaningful, domain-specific information about an error. This can improve code readability and error tracking.
```java
// Example of a custom checked exception
public class InsufficientFundsException extends Exception {
    public InsufficientFundsException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) throws InsufficientFundsException {
        if (balance < amount) {
            throw new InsufficientFundsException("Cannot withdraw " + amount + ". Insufficient funds.");
        }
        balance -= amount;
        System.out.println("Withdrawal successful. New balance: " + balance);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount(500);
        try {
            account.withdraw(600);
        } catch (InsufficientFundsException e) {
            System.err.println("Transaction failed: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

// Output
// Transaction failed: Cannot withdraw 600.0. Insufficient funds.
```

# Diagram Representation
**Exception Hierarchy** The Java exception hierarchy shows the relationship between classes, with all exceptions and errors inheriting from the `Throwable` class.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Quick Pros/Cons
*Advantages:*
- **Separation of Concerns:** Exception handling allows you to separate error-handling code from the main business logic, making the code easier to read and maintain.
    
- **Error Reporting:** Exceptions provide meaningful information about what went wrong, including the type of error, a message, and the program state at the time of the error.
    
- **Robustness:** Proper exception handling makes applications more robust and reliable by providing a clear mechanism to gracefully handle unexpected situations.
    
*Disadvantages:*
- **Performance Overhead:** Creating and throwing an exception is a relatively expensive operation, especially due to the cost of generating the stack trace. Using exceptions for normal program flow control (e.g., using a `try-catch` block inside a loop) is an anti-pattern and can lead to significant performance degradation.
    
- **Code Clutter:** Overusing `try-catch` blocks can clutter the code and reduce readability. The "throw early, catch late" principle suggests catching exceptions only at the level where they can be meaningfully handled.

## üêõ Common Issues
- **`NullPointerException`:** Occurs when you try to use an object reference that has not been initialized.
    
    - **Solution:** Check for `null` before accessing the object, use `Optional<T>`, or use a guard clause to fail early.
        
- **`NumberFormatException`:** Thrown when attempting to convert a string to a numeric type, but the string's format is incorrect.
    
    - **Solution:** Validate user input with regular expressions or other methods before attempting to parse it.
        
- **`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`:** Thrown when you try to access an array element with an invalid index.
    
    - **Solution:** Always check array bounds before accessing an element or use a `for-each` loop to iterate over the array.


---

## üí° Key Tips
- **Be Specific:** Always catch the most specific exception possible instead of a generic `Exception` or `Throwable`. This provides better error recovery and prevents you from accidentally catching serious errors.
    
- **Log Thoroughly:** When you catch an exception, log it with a clear message and the full stack trace to aid in debugging.
    
- **"Throw Early, Catch Late":** The principle is to throw an exception as soon as an error is detected and catch it at a higher level where you have enough information to handle it properly.
    
- **Use `try-with-resources`:** For resources that must be closed (like file streams or database connections), use a `try-with-resources` statement to ensure they are automatically closed, preventing resource leaks. This is a best practice introduced in Java 7.
    
- **Avoid Empty `catch` Blocks:** Do not "swallow" exceptions by catching them and doing nothing. This makes debugging extremely difficult.
