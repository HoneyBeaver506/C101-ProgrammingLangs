# üíª C101 - Programming Languages
Personalized Vault with updates of my Coding Journey. Includes all languages I will learn and plan to learn along the way. This github repo is made with the idea to add constant updates with new notes, templates and features. Feel free to use these notes for your own learning journey.

**Java Learning Journey**
*File Index with all Notes*: [[Java Index]] -  Will be used with `dataview` to create visually pleasing indexes to quickly find files
*File Database*: [[J-DB]] - Will be used with `DB Folder` for a database feel.

**CPP Learning Journey**
*Files index with all Notes:* [[CPP Index]]
*File Database*: [[J-DB]]

**Ruby Learning Journey**
*Will Come SOON!*

**Front End Programming (HTML, CSS, JS, Bun)**
*Will Come SOON!*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Copyright Warning
These notes belong to me as I paraphrased and modified them. I took inspiration from several videos in youtube however and would like to give then credit for the great zettlekesten setup. I will also be using websites likes Programmiz, Tutorial Sploit, GeeksForGeeks and FreeCodeCamp as these are the most reliable when learning code.
